## Who am I?
I am a Bachelor of Science student at Jacobs University Bremen, currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

## What do I do?
Hard to give a finite list of things. My interests change fairly frequently, but my diligence never shifts from its apex.

## Dotfiles
Here's the repository to my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/Renzum/.dotfiles). I constantly update it based on the adaptations I make to the software I use.
I only recently started maintaining them, so the quality is not at its prime.

## Current Projects
__NOTE:__ Most of the projects I start are purely for fun and education. They are usually left untouched after a certain point, simply because I do not deem them resourceful for my eductaion anymore. Unless its software that I use in my workflows.
