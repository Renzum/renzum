## Briefly About Myself
I am a graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Constructor University. Since childhood, my fascination with computers has driven me. I delved into binary at the age of 12, marking the beginning of my journey. My journey began in 2015 whenI ventured into web development, studying HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL, including frameworks. Additionally, I fulfilled a childhood aspiration by creating video games using C# and the Unity Game Engine, crafting entertaining projects for myself and my friends. In 2018, ReactJS caught my attention, which helped me develop a small storefront application for my high school. Just before starting university in 2020, I embarked on learning and prototyping with C++. Afterwards, throughout my university years, my curiosity led me to explore other languages, namely Go and Rust, which have become dear to me. Presently, I embrace the challenge of constructing distributed services through Docker containerization and Kubernetes orchestration for both enjoyment and knowledge acquisition.

## Current Interests
After using Rust for a year, and even writing my bachelor thesis on it, I decided to venture into the more complex world of Rust's procedural macros.
Currently I am going through the [Rust proc_macro workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop) by [David Tolnay](https://github.com/dtolnay).

## Current Projects
My current project is the creation of a distributed Discord Bot using Rust and PostgreSQL, with the intent of helping me manage one of my community discord servers with ~100 members. This project's purpose is not only to provide a tool for managing the social aspects of the discord community, but to also provide experience in designing, building, and maintaining complex distributed software and deploying via containerization and orchestration. In fact, one of the reasons why I delved into Rust's procedural macros was to simplify the structure of this project's source code and reduce boilerplate code.
